# The Tavern

App that will help you create D&amp;D characters, and save them in the cloud

## Description

New player to D&amp;D and don't know how to create a character sheet? Veteran player that is just tired of writing everything on pencil and paper? The Tavern offers a solution to create and store your character sheets in the cloud. Making it easier and quicker for you to get into the session!

## User Story

    As a user, I want to be able to easily make and find my existing character sheets. When I visit the site I can log into my account and navigate to the profile page where I can make a new character or see my existing characters.

## Future Development

    In the future we'd like to implement a Dungeon Master view where all the characters in the game session can be seen by the DM.

## Technologies

    [Github Projects] Project Kanban Board
    [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
    [D&D 5th Edition API] (https://www.dnd5eapi.co/)
    [NodeJS] (https://nodejs.org/en/)
    [MongoDB] (https://www.mongodb.com/)
    [BootStrap] (https://getbootstrap.com/)
    [Express] (https://expressjs.com/)

## Market Value

    Keeping track of D&D characters can be daunting, we want to create an app to help with that. Apps that are currently out are either too cluttered and don't help that problem, or are too basic and either don't let you customize as much as you want, or are just poorly made websites. We decided to make an app that helps you manage your character in an easy way, in an app that looks and feels great.
